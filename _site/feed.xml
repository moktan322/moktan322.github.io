My name is Ashish Moktan and today I am going to share my whole journey of getting started with a personal website using Ruby Jekyll Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“A good leader makes his men realize they have more ability than they think they have so that they consistently do better work than they thought they could.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; As similar, my respected CTO Budh Ram Gurung was with me in this whole journey and made me easy to shift into Ruby Programming Language which was out of my zone at that time. But he guided me so smoothly, instructed me about ruby and made me believe that I can also build a ruby project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning about Ruby my mentor advised me to go through a Jekyll. Jekyll is not a programming language: simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub’s co-founder, it is distributed under the open-source MIT license.Jekyll started a web development trend towards static websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply I cloned with my mentor GitHub where he had already made a scratch platform for the beginners so that they could easily build their confidence.
After getting familiar with jekyll, I started to write code and updated that version and now finally I am here with my first website where I will write all the blogs about my experience on any new thing, as well as blog about the project in which I will get a role.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashish Moktan</name></author><category term="practice" /><summary type="html">Journey how I get started with Personal Website!

It runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding on Ruby.
Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1993 by Yukihiro Matsumoto of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the name Yukihiro Matsumoto on the Ruby mailing list at www.ruby-lang.org. Matsumoto is also known as Matz in the Ruby community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is “A Programmer’s Best Friend”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl, Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language. Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Features of Ruby
Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a true object-oriented programming language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a clean and easy syntax that allows a new developer to learn very quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has similar syntax to that of many programming languages such as C++ and Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby is very much scalable and big programs written in Ruby are easily maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby can be used for developing Internet and intranet applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby can be installed in Windows and POSIX environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby support many GUI tools such as Tcl/Tk, GTK, and OpenGL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby can easily be connected to DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a rich set of built-in functions, which can be used directly into Ruby scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools You Will Need
For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a latest computer like Intel Core i3 or i5 with a minimum of 2GB of RAM (4GB of RAM recommended). You also will need the following software −&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux or Windows 95/98/2000/NT or Windows 7 operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache 1.3.19-5 Web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer 5.0 or above Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby 1.8.5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will provide the necessary skills to create GUI, networking, and Web applications using Ruby. It also will talk about extending and embedding Ruby applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ashish Moktan</name></author><summary type="html">Ruby is a scripting language designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz.
